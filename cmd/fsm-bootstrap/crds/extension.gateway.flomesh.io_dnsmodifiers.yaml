                    Hostname is the fully qualified domain name of a network host. This matches
                    the RFC 1123 definition of a hostname with 2 notable exceptions:

                     1. IPs are not allowed.
                     2. A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard
                        label must appear by itself as the first label.

                    Hostname can be "precise" which is a domain name without the terminating
                    dot of a network host (e.g. "foo.example.com") or "wildcard", which is a
                    domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. `*.example.com`).

                    Note that as per RFC1035 and RFC1123, a *label* must consist of lower case
                    alphanumeric characters or '-', and must start and end with an alphanumeric
                    character. No other punctuation is allowed.
